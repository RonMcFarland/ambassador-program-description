# The Open Organization Ambassadors Program at Opensource.com

## Our vision

We are the Open Organization Ambassadors, a group of Opensource.com community members dedicated to teaching others about the ways open source principles can enhance (and ultimately reshape) organizational cultures.

We write about, discuss, and evangelize organizational cultures predicated on transparency, adaptability, collaboration, inclusivity, and community.

## Our commitments

We're committed to:

* **Learning.** We're researching the ways open source values so we can better understand how they are influencing today's innovative organizational cultures, and we're always refining  the "open organization" concept, differentiating or distinguishing it from seemingly similar approaches to management and leadership.

* **Helping.** We're a trusted resource for anyone interested in leveraging the power of open principles to improve their organizations.

* **Translating.** We explain community-specific vocabularies to general audiences seeking to understand the benefits of an open approach to management and leadership.

* **Engaging.** We draw others into productive dialogues and exploratory activities that illuminate the benefits of open thinking applied to organizational contexts.

## Our methods

We do all this by:

* Publishing informative and exploratory articles on the nature of openness in contemporary organizations

* Speaking at industry and community-focused events

* Connecting with and interviewing innovative leaders, managers, and practitioners innovating in an open manner

* Maintaining a repository of high-quality, immediately accessible, and vetted resources anyone can use to implement open principles in their teams or organizations
